\section*{Python Objects}



In Python, a data type is like a label for a piece of information that tells the computer how to interpret and work with that information. It helps Python understand what kind of value you're dealing with, such as numbers, text, or a collection of items. This makes it easier to perform operations and manipulate data in a way that makes sense for the specific type of information you have.\\\

\section*{Types of Numbers}

Python has various \textit{"types"} of numbers (numeric literals). We'll mainly focus on integers and floating-point numbers.\\\

Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative.
\\\

For example: 9 and -2 are examples of integers.\\\


Floating-point numbers in Python have a decimal point in them or use an exponential (\textit{e}) to define the number. \\

For example, 0.7 and -2.09 are examples of floating-point numbers. \(4e^3\) (4 times 10 to the power of 3) is also an example of a floating-point number in Python.\\


Here is a table of the two main types we will spend most of our time working with, along with some examples:\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Examples} & \textbf{Number "Type"} \\
\hline
1, 2, -5, 1000 & Integers \\
\hline
1.2, -0.5, \(-7e^2\) & Floating-point numbers \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}\\\

\subsection*{Addition} \[2+8 = 10\]

\subsection*{Subtraction}
\[4-1 = 3\]

\subsection*{Multiplication}
\[2 * 2 = 4\]

\subsection*{Division}
\[\frac{7}{3} =2.3333333333333335\]

\subsection*{Floor Division}
\[\frac{7}{3}=2\]\\\

\\\ In Python, floor division is a mathematical operation that returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division of two numbers. It is performed using the double forward slash operator \(\text{//}\).
